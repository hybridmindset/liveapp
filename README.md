# liveapp
This is the beginning of a react-native project setup to compile for web, ios, & android. It is just the initial shell. Trying to get one app compiled to all three platforms.
There is currently a bug on Android only.

Make sure to run 
$ yarn install
#
then run 
$ yarn android

You will need to make sure all Android Studio and SDK installs are done.
